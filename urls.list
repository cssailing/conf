# This file is adapted from 'interwiki.conf' from the dokuwiki package

# Each URL may contain one of the placeholders {URL} or {NAME}
# {URL}  is replaced by the URL encoded representation of the wikiname
#        this is the right thing to do in most cases
# {NAME} this is replaced by the wikiname as given in the document
#        no further encoding is done
# If no placeholder is defined the urlencoded name is appended to the URL

# You can add more InterWiki shortcuts here.
